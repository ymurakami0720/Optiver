    "Original problem statement: Three players A, B, C play the following game. First, A picks a real number between 0 and 1 (both inclusive), then B picks a number in the same range (different from A’s choice) and finally C picks a number, also in the same range, (different from the two chosen numbers). We then pick a number in the range uniformly randomly. Whoever’s number is closest to this random number wins the game. Assume that A, B and C all play optimally and their sole goal is to maximise their chances of winning. Also assume that if one of them has several optimal choices, then that player will randomly pick one of the optimal choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "This ipynb file gives an algorithm for computing the optimal choice for player i in a p-player game (for i ≠ 0, we assume to know the choice of players 0, 1, ..., i-1).\n",
    "This ipynb file should be read in conjunction with the submitted puzzle solution, as the technical details are explained therein.\n",
    "\n",
    "We shall refer to the players as players 0, 1, 2, ..., p-1. Player 0 makes their selection first, player 1 second, and so forth.\n",
    "Throughout this document, we shall use n to denote the discretization of the interval [0,1], where we work in the discrete interval {0, 1, ..., n-1}.\n",
    "In what follows, the 'adjusted values' refer to the values chosen by players, divided by n-1 so that the choices are mapped back to the [0,1] interval. For example, if player 0 chooses the value 4 for n = 10, their adjusted value is 4/9 = 0.44."

    "Lastly, to determine the optimal choice of player 0 in the interval [0,1] for a 4-player game, we run the function compute_expected_values on multiple discretization values (20 <= n < 40, chosen arbitrarily). During each iteration, it is possible that player 0 has multiple optimal choices. In that case we take the median of those optimal choices; otherwise, we take the optimal choice. This output is divided by n-1 and stored into a list. Finally, we take the median of the list to estimate an optimal choice for player 0 in the interval [0,1]. In particular, we take the median to account for any outliers that may appear. In the output below, oc and ewp refer to the optimal choice and the expected win probability of player 0."
